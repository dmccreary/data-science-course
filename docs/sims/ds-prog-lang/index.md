## Claude Transcript

I'll create a line plot showing the popularity of programming languages in data science from 2010 to 2025. Since this requires current data about programming language trends, let me search for reliable sources first.Now let me search for more specific historical data and datasets about programming language trends:Let me fetch some specific data from the Stack Overflow surveys to get actual numbers:Let me search for more historical data about programming language trends:Now I have enough information to create a comprehensive visualization. Let me create a line plot showing programming language popularity trends from 2010-2025, using the data I've gathered from multiple sources.## Programming Language Popularity in Data Science (2010-2025)

I've created a comprehensive line plot showing the popularity trends of major programming languages used in data science from 2010 to 2025. The visualization clearly shows time on the horizontal axis starting from 2010, as requested.

**Key Findings:**

**Python's Dominance**: Python has seen explosive growth, reaching approximately 90% usage among data science professionals by 2025, with a 7 percentage point increase from 2024 to 2025 alone. Python achieved a 25.35% share in the TIOBE index by May 2025, the highest rating for any language since Java in 2001.

**R's Steady Position**: R's usage has declined to around 38% in 2025, but remains dominant in research, with more than 60% of papers using regression analysis in 2024-2025 utilizing R.

**SQL's Continued Relevance**: SQL maintains its critical role, utilized by about 53% of data science professionals for data management and querying tasks.

## Data Sources

The chart is based on comprehensive data from multiple authoritative sources:

- **TIOBE Programming Community Index**: Monthly rankings based on search engine results from 25 major search engines including Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Wikipedia
- **Stack Overflow Developer Surveys**: Annual surveys with 49,000+ to 90,000+ developers from 177 countries, providing insights into actual usage patterns
- **Industry Analysis**: Reports from DataCamp, upGrad, and other data science education platforms tracking industry trends
- **Academic Sources**: Research from Stanford University and Nature Data Science publications

The visualization demonstrates Python's rise from a niche language to the dominant force in data science, driven by its versatility in AI, machine learning, and automation, while other languages like R and SQL maintain their specialized roles in the data science ecosystem.
