## How to Play

1. Read the variable description shown in the box
2. Click one of the four buttons to classify the variable:
    - **Continuous** (blue): Numerical data that can be any value including decimals
    - **Discrete** (purple): Numerical data that can only be whole numbers
    - **Ordinal** (green): Categorical data with a meaningful order
    - **Nominal** (orange): Categorical data with no inherent order
3. Get 10 correct answers to complete the Side Quest!

## Game Features

- **Score Tracking**: Your score is displayed in the upper right corner
- **Celebration Animation**: Colorful particles burst when you answer correctly
- **Helpful Hints**: If you answer incorrectly, you'll see a hint to help you understand
- **Side Quest Complete**: Answer all 10 questions correctly to earn +100 Data Scientist Health Points!

## Learning Objectives

After playing this game, students should be able to:

1. Distinguish between numerical and categorical data
2. Identify continuous vs discrete numerical variables
3. Recognize ordinal vs nominal categorical variables
4. Apply the decision tree logic for classifying any variable

## The Four Variable Types

| Type | Category | Description | Examples |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Continuous** | Numerical | Can take any value including decimals | Height, Weight, Temperature |
| **Discrete** | Numerical | Can only be whole numbers | Number of children, Cars owned |
| **Ordinal** | Categorical | Has a meaningful order or ranking | Grade levels, Satisfaction ratings |
| **Nominal** | Categorical | No inherent order between categories | Eye color, Blood type, Country |
