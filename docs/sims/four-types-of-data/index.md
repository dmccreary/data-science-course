## About This MicroSim

This interactive infographic illustrates the four main types of data used in data science:

1. **Image Data** - Photographs, medical scans, satellite imagery
2. **Sequence Data** - Time series, text, audio, DNA sequences
3. **Tabular Data** - Spreadsheets, databases, structured records
4. **Graph Data** - Networks, relationships, social connections

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level, Subject and Topic

9th-12th grade introductory data science. Understanding data types.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify the four main types of data used in data science
- Give examples of each data type from real-world applications
- Explain which machine learning approaches work best with each data type

### Activities

#### Data Type Classification

Present students with various datasets and have them classify which of the four data types they represent.

#### Real-World Examples

Research and present examples of how each data type is used in industry (medical imaging, natural language processing, database analytics, social network analysis).
