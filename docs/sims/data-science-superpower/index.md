## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization presents **data science** as a central power source with six "superpowers" radiating outward to real-world applications. The comic book aesthetic emphasizes that data science skills are truly transformative capabilities.

## The Six Superpowers

### 1. Pattern Detection
Find hidden patterns and anomalies in complex data.

- **Fraud Detection** - PayPal, Stripe, Visa use ML to identify suspicious transactions
- **Disease Diagnosis** - IBM Watson and Google Health analyze medical images and patient data

### 2. Prediction
Forecast future events and trends from historical data.

- **Weather Forecasting** - The Weather Company and AccuWeather use massive datasets
- **Stock Markets** - Bloomberg and quantitative hedge funds predict market movements

### 3. Optimization
Find the best solution among many possibilities.

- **Route Planning** - Google Maps, UPS, and FedEx optimize delivery routes
- **Resource Allocation** - Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb match supply with demand

### 4. Automation
Enable machines to perform tasks intelligently.

- **Self-Driving Cars** - Tesla, Waymo, and Cruise process sensor data in real-time
- **Smart Assistants** - Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant understand natural language

### 5. Insight Discovery
Uncover meaningful insights from raw information.

- **Customer Behavior** - Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon personalize recommendations
- **Scientific Research** - DeepMind and OpenAI accelerate discovery

### 6. Decision Support
Provide evidence-based recommendations for choices.

- **Business Strategy** - McKinsey and Palantir analyze complex business scenarios
- **Policy Making** - World Bank and CDC use data for public policy decisions

## Interactive Features

- **Hover** over any yellow superpower node to see its description
- **Hover** over any green application node to see company examples
- **Pulsing animation** on the central core draws attention
- **Comic book action lines** create an energetic visual style

## Learning Objective

Help students visualize how data science skills connect to real-world impact and career opportunities. By seeing the breadth of applications, students understand that data science is not just about algorithms—it's about solving real problems across every industry.

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)
- Ask students: "If you could have any superpower, what would it be?"
- Introduce the idea that data science gives us real-world "superpowers"

### Exploration (10 minutes)
- Have students explore the MicroSim, hovering over each superpower
- Ask them to pick the superpower they find most interesting
- Have them hover over the applications to see real company examples

### Discussion (10 minutes)
- Which companies surprised you with their use of data science?
- Can you think of other applications for each superpower?
- Which superpower do you think will be most important in 10 years?

### Activity (15 minutes)
- Divide class into 6 groups, one per superpower
- Each group researches 2 more real-world applications
- Groups present their findings to the class

## Visual Design

- **Blue core** - Represents the foundational nature of data science
- **Yellow/gold spokes** - Superpowers radiate like energy from the core
- **Green applications** - Real-world impact, like growing results
- **Action lines** - Comic book aesthetic emphasizes dynamic power
