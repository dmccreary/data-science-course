## About This MicroSim

This interactive simulation demonstrates the probability distribution of rolling a single six-sided die. As more rolls accumulate, students can observe how the distribution approaches a uniform distribution with equal probability (1/6) for each outcome.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand uniform probability distribution
- Observe how empirical results approach theoretical probability with more trials
- Compare discrete uniform distribution to other distributions
