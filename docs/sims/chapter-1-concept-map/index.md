## How to Use This Map

- **Hover** over any concept to see its definition
- **Click** a concept to highlight all its connections
- **Double-click** a concept to see examples
- **Filter buttons** show/hide concept categories

## Concept Categories

| Category | Shape | Color | Concepts |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Core Concepts** | Circle | Gold | Data Science, Data, Variables, Dataset |
| **Data Types** | Square | Blue | Numerical, Categorical, Ordinal, Nominal |
| **Variable Roles** | Diamond | Green | Independent, Dependent, Feature, Target |
| **Workflow** | Hexagon | Purple | Data Science Workflow, Problem Definition, Data Collection |
| **Tools & Practices** | Rectangle | Orange | Python Programming, Documentation |
| **Structure** | Triangle | Teal | Measurement Scales, Observation |

## Relationship Types

| Edge Style | Meaning | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Solid gray** | "is a type of" | Numerical → Data Types |
| **Dashed blue** | "contains" | Dataset → Observation |
| **Dotted green** | "uses" | Data Science → Python Programming |
| **Thick red** | "same as" | Feature ↔ Independent Variable |

## Key Relationships to Understand

1. **Data Science works with Data** - The foundation of the field
2. **Data is organized into Variables** - How we structure information
3. **Variables are classified as Numerical or Categorical** - The fundamental split
4. **Categorical splits into Ordinal (ordered) and Nominal (unordered)**
5. **Variables can play different roles**: Independent (input) vs Dependent (output)
6. **In ML context**: Feature = Independent Variable, Target = Dependent Variable
7. **The Data Science Workflow** guides the process from Problem Definition through Data Collection

## Learning Objectives

After exploring this concept map, you should be able to:

1. Identify and define all 20 core concepts from Chapter 1
2. Explain how concepts relate to each other
3. Classify any variable by its type and role
4. Describe the data science workflow
5. Understand the equivalence between traditional statistics and ML terminology
