## About This MicroSim

This interactive vis-network visualization shows the learning progression through ten fundamental statistics MicroSims. The graph illustrates:

- **Concept dependencies** - Which concepts must be learned before others
- **Learning pathways** - Multiple valid routes through the material
- **Topic groupings** - Color-coded by subject area (fundamentals, distributions, relationships, regression, evaluation, sampling, inference)

Click on any node to see its prerequisites and what concepts it leads to.

## The Ten MicroSims

1. **Exploring Data Points** - Build intuition about observations and coordinates
2. **Histogram Builder** - Understand frequency distributions and bin sizes
3. **Mean & Median Explorer** - Compare measures of central tendency
4. **Distribution Shape Explorer** - Learn about skewness and kurtosis
5. **Correlation Playground** - Explore relationships between variables
6. **Least Squares Line Fitter** - Minimize squared residuals
7. **R² Intuition Builder** - Understand model fit quality
8. **Sampling Bias Demonstrator** - Compare biased vs. random sampling
9. **Hypothesis Testing Visualizer** - Observe p-values under null hypothesis
10. **Confidence Interval Explorer** - Visualize interval coverage
