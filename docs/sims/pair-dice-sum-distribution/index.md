## About This MicroSim

This interactive simulation demonstrates the probability distribution of rolling two six-sided dice and summing the results. Students can observe how:

- The sum of 7 is the most likely outcome (6/36 = 16.7% probability)
- The distribution forms a triangular shape
- Sums near the extremes (2 and 12) are least likely (1/36 = 2.8% probability)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand discrete probability distributions
- Calculate probabilities for compound events
- Observe the law of large numbers in action
- Connect combinatorics to probability
