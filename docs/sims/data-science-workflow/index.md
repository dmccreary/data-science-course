## About This MicroSim

This interactive infographic illustrates the six essential steps of the data science workflow:

1. **Define the Problem** - Clearly articulate the question you want to answer
2. **Collect Data** - Gather relevant data from various sources
3. **Clean Data** - Process and prepare data for analysis
4. **Analyze Data** - Apply statistical and machine learning methods
5. **Visualize Results** - Create charts and graphs to communicate findings
6. **Communicate Insights** - Share conclusions with stakeholders

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level, Subject and Topic

9th-12th grade introductory data science. Understanding the data science process.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify the six steps of the data science workflow
- Explain the purpose of each step in the process
- Describe how the steps connect to form a complete analysis pipeline

### Activities

#### Step Identification

Have students identify which step they are performing when working on a data project.

#### Real-World Examples

Discuss real-world data science projects and map them to the six-step workflow.

#### Process Ordering

Provide students with scrambled workflow steps and have them arrange them in the correct order.
