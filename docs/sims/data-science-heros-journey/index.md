## About This MicroSim

This interactive visualization presents the **data science workflow** as a hero's journey, inspired by Joseph Campbell's monomyth structure. Just as every great hero follows a journey from the ordinary world through trials and transformation, data scientists follow a similar path from initial questions to actionable insights.

## The Seven Stages

1. **Problem Definition** - "The Call to Adventure"
   - Every data science project begins with a question
   - Vague questions lead to vague answers

2. **Data Collection** - "Gathering Allies"
   - Seek data from databases, surveys, APIs, and experiments
   - Often the most challenging part of the journey

3. **Data Cleaning** - "Trials and Tribulations"
   - Fix errors, handle missing values, tame the chaos
   - The hero must face challenges before reaching the goal

4. **Exploratory Analysis** - "The Revelation"
   - Visualize and explore to find patterns
   - The fog begins to clear as insights emerge

5. **Modeling** - "Forging the Weapon"
   - Build your predictive model
   - Create the tool that will help you conquer uncertainty

6. **Evaluation** - "The Ultimate Test"
   - Does your model actually work?
   - Test your creation against reality

7. **Communication** - "Return with the Elixir"
   - Share your discoveries with the world
   - The journey is complete when knowledge is shared

## Interactive Features

- **Hover** over any stage to see a detailed description
- **Click** any stage to view real-world examples
- **Auto-animate** toggle cycles through stages with a glowing effect
- **Return arrows** show the iterative nature of data science (dotted lines)

## Learning Objective

Help students understand the iterative nature of the data science workflow and see it as an adventure rather than a checklist. The circular layout emphasizes that data science is not a linear process - you often need to return to earlier stages as you learn more.

## Embedding This MicroSim

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)
- Discuss the concept of the hero's journey in storytelling
- Ask students: "What challenges do heroes face on their journeys?"

### Exploration (10 minutes)
- Have students explore the MicroSim, hovering over each stage
- Ask them to click on stages and read the real-world examples
- Discuss: "Which stage do you think is most challenging? Why?"

### Discussion (10 minutes)
- Focus on the dotted "return" arrows
- Ask: "Why would a data scientist need to go back to earlier stages?"
- Examples: Model not working might mean bad data, new questions emerge from findings

### Activity (15 minutes)
- Give students a scenario (e.g., "Predict which students might need tutoring")
- Have them walk through all 7 stages, describing what they would do at each
- Emphasize that it's okay to go back - that's part of the process!
