# 10 Basic Statistics Review MicroSims

Here’s a scaffolded set of **Ten Basic Statistics MicroSims** designed for students entering your data science course without a strong statistics background.
I’ve ordered them from simplest to more complex, drawing from the MicroSim styles already in your library.


## 1. Exploring Data Points

### Description

Students click to add or remove points on a 2D scatter plot, instantly seeing the effect on the dataset.

### Learning Goals

* Recognize individual data points as observations.
* Understand how points are represented in x–y coordinates.
* See how changes in points affect the shape of a dataset.

### Input Controls

1. **Add Point** (click on canvas)
2. **Remove Point** (click existing point)
3. **Clear All Points** (button)


## 2. Histogram Builder

### Description

Students adjust bin sizes to see how histograms change, revealing over-smoothing or excessive detail.

### Learning Goals

* Understand bins and frequency counts.
* Relate bin size to detail retention in data.
* Connect histograms to raw data.

### Input Controls

1. **Bin Size Slider**
2. **Dataset Selector** (normal, uniform, skewed)
3. **Toggle Grid Lines** (checkbox)


## 3. Mean and Median Explorer

### Description

Drag points along a number line to see how the mean and median respond differently to changes.

### Learning Goals

* Differentiate mean vs. median.
* Understand how outliers affect each measure.
* See why median is more robust.

### Input Controls

1. **Drag Points** (mouse)
2. **Add Outlier** (button)
3. **Reset Points** (button)


## 4. Distribution Shape Explorer

### Description

Morph between uniform, normal, skewed, and bimodal distributions and see parameter changes in real time.

### Learning Goals

* Identify common distribution shapes.
* Understand skewness and kurtosis.
* Connect distribution properties to data characteristics.

### Input Controls

1. **Distribution Type Selector**
2. **Skewness Slider**
3. **Kurtosis Slider**


## 5. Correlation Playground

### Description

Students drag clusters of points to change correlation and watch the correlation coefficient update.

### Learning Goals

* Visualize correlation strength and direction.
* Understand positive, negative, and zero correlation.
* See the impact of noise on correlation.

### Input Controls

1. **Drag Cluster** (mouse)
2. **Add Noise** (slider)
3. **Show Best Fit Line** (toggle)


## 6. Least Squares Line Fitter

### Description

Adjust slope and intercept to minimize squared residuals with visual feedback.

### Learning Goals

* Understand slope, intercept, and residuals.
* Experience manual fitting before automation.
* Build intuition for regression.

### Input Controls

1. **Slope Slider**
2. **Intercept Slider**
3. **Toggle Residual Squares** (checkbox)


## 7. R² Intuition Builder

### Description

Manipulate data spread around a regression line and see how R² changes.

### Learning Goals

* Understand what R² measures.
* Relate R² to model fit.
* Recognize limits of R² as a single metric.

### Input Controls

1. **Noise Level Slider**
2. **Number of Points Slider**
3. **Reset Dataset** (button)


## 8. Sampling Bias Demonstrator

### Description

Draw samples from representative or biased datasets to see effects on mean/median estimates.

### Learning Goals

* Recognize sampling bias.
* Connect bias to flawed conclusions.
* Practice identifying representative samples.

### Input Controls

1. **Sampling Method Selector** (random, biased)
2. **Sample Size Slider**
3. **Reset Data** (button)


## 9. Hypothesis Testing Visualizer

### Description

Adjust sample statistics to see how p-values change under different population means.

### Learning Goals

* Understand null and alternative hypotheses.
* Interpret p-values visually.
* See the effect of sample size on significance.

### Input Controls

1. **Population Mean Slider**
2. **Sample Mean Slider**
3. **Sample Size Slider**


## 10. Confidence Interval Explorer

### Description

Show multiple sample means with confidence intervals to explore coverage probability.

### Learning Goals

* Understand confidence intervals conceptually.
* Connect sample size to interval width.
* Interpret intervals in the context of repeated sampling.

### Input Controls

1. **Confidence Level Slider**
2. **Sample Size Slider**
3. **Number of Samples Slider**
