Please create highly detailed wide-landscape image of an old map.  The width:height ratio is 2:1.

Use a style of a very old circular journey map with curved dashed paths between locations circumventing mountains, lakes, swamps, ravines and deep dark forests.  Place "Here there be dragons" at the edges of the map.
The circular journey map used old treasure-map aesthetic with stages arranged in circle with forward arrows on winding paths. 

Present data science workflow as an engaging hero's journey (like Joseph Campbell books) with circular/iterative flow.

Place a title in the center of the circle. "Data Science Quest"
