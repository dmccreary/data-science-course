## Sample Prompt

```linenums="0"
I am preparing a review quiz for a freshman course called "Introduction to Data Science with Python".
For the concept of the NumPy Python library, create a four-answer
multiple choice question
about what it is primarily used for in Data Science.  Create three
plausible destructor answers that are not correct but have a
similar form to the correct answer.  Use the following format:

#### What is the primary purpose of the NumPy?

A. Bla Bla Bla
B. Bla Bla Bla
C. Bla Bla Bla
D. Bla Bla Bla

## Response

#### What is the primary purpose of NumPy?

A. Data visualization and creating complex plots for reports
B. Machine learning model training and hyperparameter tuning
C. Performing numerical computations and handling multi-dimensional arrays
D. Creating interactive web-based dashboards for data exploration

??? note "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. NumPy is primarily used for numerical computations, including working with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and providing mathematical functions to perform operations on these arrays efficiently.
