!!! prompt
   Please generate a detailed course description for a 10-week class on the subject of introduction to data science with Python.

    The course description should be written in Markdown.  Follow Bloom's 2001 taxonomy.

    The course description follows an  online textbook about data science using the Python programming language.  The audience is advanced high-school students or freshmen in college.  The focus of the textbook is a series of interactive simulations (MicroSims) that allow the students to interact with data.  We start with simple linear regression and then build increasingly complicated predictive models with Python libraries like NumPy and PyTorch.  The focus is to find the simplest model that combines expandability with prediction fidelity.

## Key Learning Principles

**Interactive Learning:** Each week features hands-on MicroSims that allow students to manipulate parameters and observe results in real-time, reinforcing theoretical concepts through experiential learning.

**Scaffolded Complexity:** The course progresses systematically from simple linear relationships to complex neural networks, ensuring students build confidence before tackling advanced topics.

**Explainable AI Focus:** Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on understanding and interpreting models rather than simply achieving high accuracy, preparing students for ethical and transparent data science practice.

**Real-world Applications:** All examples and projects use authentic datasets and scenarios, helping students connect academic learning to practical problem-solving.

## Course Philosophy

This course is built on the principle that effective data science requires both technical competence and critical thinking. Students will learn not just how to build predictive models, but when to use them, how to interpret their results, and how to communicate findings to diverse audiences. The integration of interactive simulations ensures that abstract mathematical concepts become concrete and intuitive, while the progression from simple to complex models helps students appreciate the value of parsimony in modeling.

By the end of this course, students will have developed both the technical skills and analytical mindset necessary for success in advanced data science coursework or entry-level positions in data-driven fields.
