# Generate List of MicroSims for Data Science

!!! prompt
    You are in expert at creating great instructional designs using interactive simulations.

    Please create a list of the 100 most difficult concepts to learn a course called "Introduction to Data Science with Python" and suggest a detailed list of MicroSims that could be used to explain these concepts to students.

    MicroSims are interactive in-browser simulations and animations that allow students to click on the screen and learn data science concepts.  They are often written in JavaScript libraries like p5.js.  MicroSims have input controls like buttons and sliders that students can click.  We can add logging tools to these controls to see what events the student clicked on.

    An example of a data-science MicroSim is a "least square" MicroSim that allows the student to change the slop and intercept which will minimize the area of squares on a graph.

    For each MicroSim generate:

    1. The Name of the MicroSim in Level 2 Markdown Header
    2. A short description of the MicroSim in level 3 markdown
    3. The learning goals of the MicroSim in level 3 markdown
    4. A list of the input controls that the student could change in a numbered list

    Focus on good instructional design and step-by-step learning from simple to complex.  Begin with simple MicroSims and move on to more complex MicroSims.
