**Example:** A variance of 4 means average squared deviations are 4 units².

#### Vectorization

Performing operations on entire arrays rather than using loops.
**Example:** Adding two NumPy arrays without explicit loops.

#### Visualization

The graphical representation of data to reveal patterns and insights.
**Example:** Using Matplotlib to plot a scatter diagram of height vs. weight.

#### Visual Studio Code

A free integrated development environment that is used widely by programmers and data science science professionals.

Visual Studio Code (VS-Code) also has many extensions for editing different languages and data types.

Other examples of AI-based IDEs include Cursor and Windsurf.  The Cline extension is also useful.

**Example:** We use VS-Code to edit, run, debug and test our Python code.

#### Weighted Average

An average where each value contributes according to its assigned weight.
**Example:** Calculating a final grade with different weights for assignments and exams.

#### Weight (Model)

A parameter that determines the influence of a feature in a model’s prediction.
**Example:** A weight of 0.5 for "hours studied" in a regression model.

#### White Noise (Time Series)

A random sequence of values with no predictable pattern.
**Example:** Fluctuations in daily stock prices without a trend.

#### Wilcoxon Test

A non-parametric test for comparing paired samples.
**Example:** Comparing pre- and post-training test scores without assuming normality.

#### YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language)

A human-readable data serialization format.
**Example:** Storing configuration settings in a YAML file.

#### z-Score

A standardized score indicating how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.
**Example:** A z-score of 2 means the value is two standard deviations above the mean.

#### Zero-Inflated Data

Data with an excess number of zero values compared to a standard distribution.
**Example:** A dataset of monthly purchases where many customers have zero purchases.

#### Zero-Shot Learning

A machine learning method where a model makes predictions for classes it was not explicitly trained on.
**Example:** A text classifier identifying a new topic without prior examples.
