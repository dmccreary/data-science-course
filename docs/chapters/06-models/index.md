# Model Evaluation and Validation

1. Measuring model performance (RÂ², MSE, MAE)
2. Training and testing data splits
3. MicroSim: Cross-validation simulation
4. Understanding overfitting and underfitting
5. Bias-variance trade-off
6. Model selection criteria
7. Performance metrics for different problem types
