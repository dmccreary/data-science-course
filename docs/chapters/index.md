## How to Use This Textbook

This textbook is designed to be read sequentially, as each chapter builds upon concepts from previous chapters. The learning graph ensures that prerequisite concepts are always introduced before they are needed. However, if you have prior experience with certain topics, you may skip ahead while referring back to earlier chapters as needed.

Each chapter includes interactive MicroSims to reinforce learning through hands-on exploration.
