# Python Data Structures

## Summary

This chapter introduces the essential data structures used in Python data science workflows. Students will learn Python's native data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, arrays) and then progress to pandas, the primary library for data manipulation. The chapter covers DataFrames and Series, data loading from CSV files, and methods for inspecting and selecting data. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to load, explore, and navigate datasets using pandas.
