# Introduction to Data Science

## Summary

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of data science, establishing the vocabulary and mental models needed for the rest of the course. Students will learn what data science is, understand the data science workflow from problem definition to data collection, and master the different types of data and measurement scales. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to identify variables, distinguish between independent and dependent variables, and understand the structure of datasets.
