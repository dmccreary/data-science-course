# NumPy and Numerical Computing

## Summary

This chapter introduces NumPy, the fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. Students will learn to create and manipulate NumPy arrays, understand array shapes and indexing, and leverage broadcasting for efficient operations. The chapter covers vectorized operations, matrix mathematics, and linear algebra concepts essential for machine learning. By the end of this chapter, students will understand why NumPy is critical for computational efficiency and be able to perform fast numerical computations.
