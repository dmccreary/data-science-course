# Multiple Linear Regression

## Summary

This chapter extends linear regression to handle multiple predictor variables. Students will learn to build models with multiple features, understand and diagnose multicollinearity, and apply various feature selection methods. The chapter covers handling categorical variables through dummy variables and one-hot encoding, creating interaction terms, and understanding feature importance. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to build and interpret multiple regression models with both numerical and categorical predictors.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Multiple Linear Regression
