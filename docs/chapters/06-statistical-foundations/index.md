# Statistical Foundations

## Summary

This chapter establishes the statistical foundation essential for data science and machine learning. Students will learn descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation), understand distributions and probability, and explore sampling concepts. The chapter covers hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and measures of association including correlation and covariance. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to summarize datasets statistically, understand the relationship between variables, and make probabilistic inferences.
