# Simple Linear Regression

## Summary

This chapter introduces regression analysis, the foundation of predictive modeling. Students will learn the mathematics behind linear regression, including the least squares method, interpreting coefficients (slope and intercept), and understanding residuals. The chapter covers regression assumptions and teaches students to implement linear regression using scikit-learn. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to build simple linear regression models, interpret their outputs, and make predictions.
