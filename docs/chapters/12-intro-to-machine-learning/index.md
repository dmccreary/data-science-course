# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Summary

This chapter provides a conceptual foundation for machine learning. Students will learn the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning, understand the training process, and explore key concepts like generalization and error types. The chapter covers loss and cost functions, optimization theory, and gradient descent as the fundamental algorithm for training models. By the end of this chapter, students will understand how machine learning models learn from data and be prepared for neural networks.
