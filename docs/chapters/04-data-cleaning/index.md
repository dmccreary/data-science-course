# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## Summary

This chapter covers the critical skills of preparing raw data for analysis. Students will learn to identify and handle missing values, detect and remove duplicates, identify outliers, and validate data quality. The chapter also covers data transformation techniques including filtering, type conversion, and feature scaling. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to clean messy real-world datasets and prepare them for visualization and modeling.
