# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## Summary

This chapter teaches students how to create effective data visualizations using matplotlib and Seaborn. Students will learn the matplotlib architecture (figures and axes), create various plot types (line, scatter, bar, histogram, box, pie), and customize their visualizations with titles, labels, legends, and colors. The chapter emphasizes choosing appropriate visualizations for different data types. By the end of this chapter, students will be able to create publication-quality visualizations that effectively communicate insights from data.
