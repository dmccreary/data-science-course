# Foundations of Data Science

## Introduction to Data Science and Its Applications

Data science is the discipline of extracting meaningful insights from data by combining **statistics**, **programming**, and **domain expertise**. It powers many of the services and tools we use every dayâ€”from recommendation engines on streaming platforms to real-time fraud detection in banking. Governments, businesses, and non-profits alike depend on data science to make **evidence-based decisions** and improve efficiency.

Applications of data science span nearly every field:

* **Healthcare:** Predicting disease risks, optimizing treatment effectiveness, and analyzing healthcare costs.
* **Finance:** Credit scoring, algorithmic trading, and fraud detection.
* **Retail:** Personalized recommendations and demand forecasting.
* **Transportation:** Route optimization and autonomous vehicle navigation.
* **Environmental Science:** Climate modeling and resource management.

## Why Python for Data Science?

Python is the most widely used programming language for data science. It is popular because of:

* A rich **ecosystem of libraries** (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, PyTorch).
* Readable, beginner-friendly syntax.
* Strong community support and open-source resources.

Over the past 15 years, Python has steadily risen to become the dominant language in data science. Other languages such as R, Java, and Julia are used in specific contexts, but Pythonâ€™s versatility has made it the industry standard.

Here is an interactive time-series chart showing the change in popularity of different languages used in data science.  You can hover over each year to see what percent each language had in data science that year.

## Understanding the Data Science Workflow

Every data science project follows a structured workflow:

This workflow is iterative. A failed model often sends us back to collect new data or engineer better features.

Above is an interactive infographic that allows you to explore the six steps in a typical data
science workflow.  For each step, hover over the step and view the text description below the
step.

1. **Define the problem** â€“ Clarify what question is being answered.
2. **Collect data** â€“ Gather raw data from reliable sources.
3. **Clean and preprocess data** â€“ Handle missing values, errors, and inconsistencies.
4. **Explore and visualize** â€“ Use plots and descriptive statistics to understand patterns.
5. **Modeling and Analysis** â€“ Build predictive or explanatory models.
7. **Deploy and communicate results** â€“ Share findings with stakeholders.


## Four Types of Data Representations

In this course we will be looking at many ways to represent both raw data as well as
connected knowledge.  Here is an interactive illustration of these four ways we represent
different types of information.

<iframe src="../../sims/four-types-of-data/main.html" height="600" scrolling="no"></iframe>

These types are:

1. **Images** - Visual data represented as pixel arrays with RGB color values. Each pixel contains red, green, and blue color components. Common in computer vision, medical imaging, satellite imagery, and photo recognition. Neural networks like CNNs are specifically designed to process this type of spatial data structure.
2. **Sequences** - Sequences: Ordered data where position and timing matter critically. Examples include time series data, natural language text, DNA sequences, audio signals, and stock prices. RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers are designed to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data.
3. **Tabular** -  Structured data organized in rows and columns, similar to spreadsheets or databases. Each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature or variable. This is the most common data type in traditional machine learning, handled well by algorithms like random forests, SVM, and gradient boosting.  We can use Python data frames to manipulate tabular data.
4. **Graph** - Graph: Network data representing relationships and connections between entities. Nodes represent objects (people, websites, molecules) while edges represent relationships (friendships, links, bonds). Used in social network analysis, recommendation systems, knowledge graphs, and molecular modeling. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are specialized for this data type.


Future chapters will focus on different ways we represent this information and how our models vary based on the type of data we are working with.

## Basic Atomic Data Types and Structures in Python

Before analyzing data, students must understand how Python stores fundamental atomic entities like numbers and string. 
In this course we will look at some of the core Python atomic **atomic data types** include:

* **Integers** (whole numbers, e.g., `42`)
* **Floats** (decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`)
* **Strings** (text, e.g., `"data science"`)
* **Booleans** (`True` or `False`)

Core **data structures** include:

* **Lists** â€“ ordered, mutable collections (e.g., `[1,2,3]`)
* **Tuples** â€“ ordered, immutable collections (e.g., `(1,2,3)`)
* **Dictionaries** â€“ key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 20}`)
* **Sets** â€“ unordered, unique elements (e.g., `{1,2,3}`)

Later in the course, we will rely heavily on **NumPy arrays** and **Pandas DataFrames**, which are optimized for data manipulation.

## Data Science Roles and Career Paths

Data science is a team effort, involving many specialized roles:

* **Data Scientist:** Builds models, interprets results, and communicates insights.
* **Data Engineer:** Designs pipelines and storage systems for reliable data access.
* **Machine Learning Engineer:** Deploys and optimizes models in production systems.
* **Business Analyst:** Translates data insights into actionable strategies.
* **Ethics & Compliance Specialist:** Ensures fairness, transparency, and privacy in projects.

These roles often overlap, and many entry-level positions expect a blend of programming, statistics, and communication skills.

## Ethics and Best Practices in Data Science

Data science has great potential, but also significant risks. Poorly designed or biased models can reinforce inequalities or cause harm. To practice **ethical data science**, we must:

* **Protect privacy**: Respect data ownership and confidentiality.
* **Avoid bias**: Check datasets and models for fairness across subgroups.
* **Be transparent**: Document methods and assumptions clearly.
* **Ensure reproducibility**: Use version control and pipelines so results can be verified.
* **Balance efficiency and responsibility**: Consider environmental and social impacts.

### Sample Hands-On Lab: Exploring Sample Datasets with Python Dataframes

To begin, we will explore a real-world datasets.  Let's say a friend of yours complained that the
healthcare costs in the country that you live it were unreasonably high compared to other
countries.  Can you provide evidence to prove or disprove this claim?

A simple but practical task is to generate a **CSV file** of **per-capita annual healthcare costs for 2023** across the 100 largest countries. 

You will then use Python to:

1. Load the data into a Pandas **DataFrame**.
2. Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
3. Create visualizations such as bar charts and scatter plots.
4. Ask ChatGPT (or another LLM) to interpret the results and suggest insights.

Here is a sample of what this data looks like:

```csv
Country Name,Country Code,Health_Exp_Per_Capita_2022
Africa Eastern and Southern,AFE,228
Afghanistan,AFG,383
Africa Western and Central,AFW,201
Angola,AGO,217
Albania,ALB,1186
Andorra,AND,5136
Arab World,ARB,776
United Arab Emirates,ARE,3814
Argentina,ARG,2664
Armenia,ARM,1824
Antigua and Barbuda,ATG,1436
```

You can download this sample data here: [Worldwide Healthcare Costs Per Capita for 2022](https://github.com/dmccreary/data-science-course/blob/main/data/lab-01/healthcare-per-capita-2022.csv)

Note that this list from the World Bank includes not just countries, but also regions like "Africa Wester and Central".
