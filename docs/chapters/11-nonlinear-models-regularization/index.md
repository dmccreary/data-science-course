# Non-linear Models and Regularization

## Summary

This chapter expands modeling capabilities beyond linear relationships. Students will learn polynomial regression for capturing non-linear patterns, various transformation techniques, and the concept of model flexibility. The chapter introduces regularization as a technique for preventing overfitting, covering Ridge regression, Lasso regression, and Elastic Net. By the end of this chapter, students will understand how to balance model complexity with generalization and apply regularization to improve model performance.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Non-linear Regression

8. Model Flexibility
9. Regularization
10. Ridge Regression
11. Lasso Regression
12. Elastic Net
13. Regularization Parameter
