## Category Descriptions

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts
Core concepts that introduce data science terminology and fundamental ideas. These are typically the first concepts students encounter and form the basis for all other learning.

### PYENV - Python Environment
Concepts related to setting up and managing the Python development environment, including installation, package managers, virtual environments, and IDEs.

### DSTRC - Data Structures
Python native data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples) and pandas structures (DataFrame, Series). These are essential for data manipulation.

### CLEAN - Data Cleaning
Techniques for preparing data for analysis including handling missing values, detecting outliers, removing duplicates, and transforming data.

### VIZ - Visualization
Data visualization concepts using matplotlib and seaborn, including various plot types, customization, and best practices for visual communication.

### STATS - Statistics
Statistical foundations including descriptive statistics, probability, distributions, correlation, and hypothesis testing.

### REGR - Regression
Linear regression concepts from simple to multiple regression, including model fitting, interpretation, and assumptions.

### EVAL - Model Evaluation
Techniques for assessing model performance, including metrics, train/test splits, cross-validation, and understanding overfitting/underfitting.

### ADVR - Advanced Regression
Advanced modeling techniques including multiple regression, feature engineering, regularization (Ridge, Lasso), and non-linear models.

### NUMPY - NumPy Computing
NumPy library concepts including array operations, broadcasting, vectorization, and linear algebra for efficient computation.

### ML - Machine Learning
Introduction to machine learning paradigms, supervised/unsupervised learning, optimization algorithms, and gradient descent.

### NN - Neural Networks
Artificial neural network concepts including architecture, activation functions, forward/backward propagation, and deep learning.

### TORCH - PyTorch
PyTorch-specific concepts including tensors, autograd, neural network modules, optimizers, and training workflows.

### BEST - Best Practices
Professional practices including explainability, reproducibility, documentation, version control, and ethical considerations.

### PROJ - Projects
Applied concepts for real-world projects including end-to-end pipelines, model deployment, and communicating results.
