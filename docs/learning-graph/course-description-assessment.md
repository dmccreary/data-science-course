## Overall Quality Score: 95/100

## Strengths

- **Excellent Bloom's Taxonomy Coverage**: All six cognitive levels are represented with 4+ specific, actionable outcomes at each level
- **Comprehensive Weekly Schedule**: 10-week curriculum provides clear learning progression
- **Clear Target Audience**: Specifically identifies advanced high school and college freshmen
- **Strong Prerequisites**: Appropriately scoped for the target audience
- **Pedagogical Philosophy**: Emphasizes explainable AI and model interpretability
- **Assessment Methods**: Clear breakdown of formative (60%) and summative (40%) assessment
- **MicroSim Integration**: Interactive simulations embedded throughout each week

## Areas for Minor Improvement

- Could add explicit "Topics NOT Covered" section to set clear boundaries
  - Example: "This course does not cover deep learning architectures beyond basic neural networks, time series analysis, natural language processing, or big data technologies like Spark"
