# Chapter 1 Transitions - Session Log

**Date:** 2025-12-17
**Task:** Add explanatory text between MicroSims in Chapter 1

## Overview

Reviewed Chapter 1 (Introduction to Data Science) and identified areas where transitions between MicroSims were abrupt or lacked explanatory context. Added instructional text to improve the flow and help students understand what each interactive element demonstrates.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Science Superpower Concept Map (line 63)
**Before:** MicroSim appeared immediately after "Sound like a superpower? That's because it is."

**Added:**
> The concept map below previews the key skills and ideas you'll master throughout this course. Hover over each node to see how these superpowers connect and build upon each other.

---

### 2. Variable Types Decision Tree (line 110)
**Before:** Brief intro "the TYPE of variable determines what you can do with it" then directly to MicroSim.

**Added:**
> How do you figure out what type a variable is? Use the decision tree below. Start at the top and answer each question—the flowchart will guide you to the correct classification. This simple process works for ANY variable you'll ever encounter.

---

### 3. Measurement Scales Pyramid (line 205)
**Before:** "Why Does This Matter?" callout box, then directly to MicroSim.

**Added:**
> The pyramid below shows how measurement scales build on each other—each level adds new mathematical operations you can perform. Hover over each level to see examples and learn which statistical operations are valid at that scale.

---

### 4. Variable Type Sorter (line 259)
**Before:** MicroSim appeared immediately after the Measurement Scales Pyramid details block with no introduction.

**Added:** New subsection with heading and instructional text:
> ### Practice Makes Perfect: Sorting Variables
>
> Now that you understand the different data types and measurement scales, it's time to test your skills. The best way to master variable classification is through practice—the more variables you categorize, the more automatic it becomes.
>
> Use the interactive sorter below to drag variables into their correct categories. Don't worry if you make mistakes at first—that's how learning works! Pay attention to the feedback and think about WHY each variable belongs in its category.

### 5. Data Science Workflow Hero's Journey (line 403)
**Before:** Numbered list of 7 workflow stages, then directly to MicroSim.

**Added (before MicroSim):**
> The visualization below maps this workflow to the classic hero's journey from storytelling. Just like any great adventure, your data science quest will have challenges to overcome, mentors to guide you, and ultimately a transformation that changes how you see the world. Explore each stage to see how the hero's journey parallels your path to becoming a data scientist.

**Added (after MicroSim):**
> Now let's dive deeper into the first two stages of the workflow, which you'll encounter in every data science project.

---

### 6. Chapter 1 Concept Mind Map (line 525)
**Before:** Recap bullet points, then directly to MicroSim.

**Added:**
> The concept map below shows how all 20 concepts from this chapter connect to each other. Notice how **Data Science** sits at the center, with branches extending to data types, variable roles, the workflow, and tools. Click on any concept to highlight its connections and see how the pieces fit together.

---

## No Changes Needed

- **Independent vs Dependent Variable MicroSim:** Already had strong contextual text explaining the cause-and-effect relationship and the importance of understanding this concept for prediction.

## File Modified

- `docs/chapters/01-intro-to-data-science/index.md`

## Instructional Design Principles Applied

1. **Scaffolding:** Each MicroSim now has context that prepares students for what they'll see and do
2. **Clear Instructions:** Interactive elements include guidance on how to use them (hover, click, drag)
3. **Purpose Statements:** Students understand WHY each visualization matters before engaging with it
4. **Transitions:** Smooth flow between content sections and interactive elements
5. **Encouragement:** Practice sections include reassurance that mistakes are part of learning
